<p>Hi, my name is <strong>Jin Wook Mook </strong> and I am currently studying at Curtin University in Australia, majoring in <strong> Business Information Systems.</strong> Before joining Curtin University, I completed my studies at Curtin College, where I gained a solid foundation in these fields. The program at Curtin College provided me with a strong understanding of the fundamentals of programming. This has prepared me well for the more advanced coursework at Curtin University, where I am excited to continue to expand my knowledge and skills in these areas. I am passionate about using technology to create innovative solutions to complex problems, and studying these fields will help me achieve my goals. I am looking forward to the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead as I continue my academic journey at <strong>Curtin University.</strong></p>
